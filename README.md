**Main technologies used**
React, Vite, React Router

Tailwind CSS

Node.js, Express

MongoDB / Mongoose

JWT (jsonwebtoken)

react-hook-form, react-datepicker, react-share

axios, react-hot-toast

Core features
Authentication: Email/password registration + optional social login; password validation (uppercase, lowercase, min 6 chars). JWT returned on login/register and used for protected routes.

**Navbar**: Dynamic links (Home, Membership, Notifications, Join Us/Login). Profile picture dropdown with Dashboard, Logout.

**Search & Tags**: Backend search by post tags; tag list UI; search results show under the banner.

**Posts**: Create, read, edit (owner only), delete (optional owner only). Each post shows author, title, tags, time, votes, and comment count.

**Post details**: Author image/name, title, description, tag, time, upvote/downvote, share (react-share), and comment list. Only logged-in users can comment or vote.

**Voting**: upVote and downVote counters; total popularity computed as upVote - downVote. Sort posts by popularity (aggregation).

**Pagination**: Home page paginated (5 posts per page). Admin/user tables have pagination (10 rows/page).

**Comments & Reporting**: Separate comments collection; reporting mechanism with feedback dropdown; admins view & act on reports.

**Membership**: Payment page (mock/real) that upgrades a user to Gold badge; Gold users can post more than 5 posts.

**Dashboards**: User dashboard (My Profile, Add Post, My Posts) and Admin dashboard (Manage Users, Reported Activities, Make Announcement, Admin Profile).

**Events**: Create Event (future-only date enforced), Upcoming Events listing, Join Event (stores user-event join), Manage & Joined events pages.

**Theme toggle**: Dark / Light mode across the site.

**Notifications** / Announcements: Announcements stored in collection; notification icon shows count when announcements exist.

**Extras**: Carousel banner, gallery, newsletter UI section, toasts/sweet alerts for UX, and loading spinners.
